- Accessibility prefs are device-local (localStorage) applied as `data-*` attributes on `<html>` and styled in `styles.css`; why: works without accounts and across all components.
- Self-hosted download lives in `selfhost/`: a Vite build (`selfhost/vite.selfhost.mjs`) aliases the cloud client to `selfhost/client/supabase-shim.ts`, which talks to the PHP+SQLite API in `selfhost/server/`; why: lets the same game code run on the user's own PHP host without Lovable. Keep shim, PHP table rules and RPCs in sync when Online.tsx queries change.
- Player-facing names/descriptions and Pärt's lines live in `src/game/tekstid.ts` and are applied onto data objects by `applyTekstid`; the self-hosted build also loads an optional `tekstid.json` at runtime; why: typo fixes in one place, editable on the user's server without rebuilding.
- Tutorial milestones use stable IDs persisted in the game save and are updated by the engine; why: spending resources or declining needs must not undo completed onboarding.
- Only the visible tab uploads the server save, and loading a server save keeps the higher Tuhkade tee step; why: a forgotten background tab/device must not roll progress back.
- Faction depth (relations, contracts, rank perks, secrets, exclusive gear, daily event) lives in `src/game/factions.ts`; rank perks feed `progress.bonus()`; why: one place for faction rules and their effect on combat/loot.
- HUD vital stats share a native progress-based presenter, and journal colors map existing event types in the presentation layer; why: consistent accessible indicators without changing game rules.
- Map action and frontier grids respond to their content container width, and names wrap instead of truncating; why: the sidebar leaves less space than viewport-based breakpoints assume.
- Survivor (NPC) roles — passive bonus, cooldown service, capped timestamp-based camp production, expedition companion — live in `src/game/survivors.ts` and are stored in the game save; why: works on the self-hosted PHP server without cron jobs.
